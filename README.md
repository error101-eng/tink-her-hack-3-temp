### Project Description
connecting restaurants with excess food to charities ensuring that surplus food reaches those who need it the most.
### The Problem statement
Millions of people struggle with hunger and food insecurity, while simultaneously, a significant amount of surplus food is wasted by restaurants and food establishments. The lack of a streamlined system to connect excess food with those in need results in:

- An estimated one-third of all food produced globally being lost or wasted.
- Food waste contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation.
- Vulnerable populations, including the homeless, low-income families, and individuals, struggling to access nutritious food.

### The Solution
Food Rescue and Redistribution Platform*

Develop a user-friendly platform that connects restaurants with excess food to local charities and food banks, ensuring that surplus food reaches those who need it most. The platform will:

- Enable restaurants to easily donate excess food and reduce waste.
- Provide charities and food banks with a reliable source of nutritious food.
- Facilitate logistics and transportation of donated food to ensure timely delivery.
- Track and measure the impact of food donations, reducing food waste and supporting those in need.

By bridging the gap between food surplus and demand, the platform will contribute to:

- Reduced food waste and environmental impact.
- Increased food security and access to nutritious meals for vulnerable populations.
- Strengthened community relationships between restaurants, charities, and those in need.
